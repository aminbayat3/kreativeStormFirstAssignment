          In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance
          and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last
          uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way
          through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of
          its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus
          began the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven
          men. When their ship was finally crushed between two ice floes, they
          attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South
          Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization.
