        In August 1914, polar explorer Ernest Shackleton boarded the Endurance
        and set sail for Antarctica, where he planned to cross the last
        uncharted continent on foot. In January 1915, after battling its way
        through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day's sail short of its
        destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. Thus began
        the legendary ordeal of Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men.
        When their ship was finally crushed between two ice floes, they
        attempted a near-impossible journey over 850 miles of the South
        Atlantic's heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization.
