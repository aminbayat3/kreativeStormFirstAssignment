        Using the theories of Alfred Adler, one of the three giants of
        20th-century psychology, The Courage to Be Disliked follows an
        illuminating conversation between a philosopher and a young man. The
        philosopher explains to his pupil how each of us is able to determine
        our own life, free from the shackles of past experiences, doubts, and
        the expectations of others. It's a way of thinking that is deeply
        liberating, allowing us to develop the courage to change and to ignore
        the limitations that we and other people have placed on us. The result
        is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance.
        Millions have already read and benefited from its wisdom. This truly
        life-changing audiobook will help you declutter your mind of harmful
        thoughts and attitudes, helping you to make a lasting change, achieve
        real happiness, and find success.
