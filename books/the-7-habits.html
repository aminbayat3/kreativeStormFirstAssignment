          Considered one of the most inspiring books ever written, The 7 Habits
          of Highly Effective People has guided generations of readers for the
          past three decades. Presidents and CEOs have kept it by their
          bedsides, students have underlined and studied passages from it,
          teachers and parents have drawn from it, and individuals of all ages
          and occupations have used its step-by-step pathway to adapt to change
          and take advantage of the opportunities that change creates. Now this
          thirtieth anniversary edition of the timeless classic commemorates the
          wisdom of the 7 habits with fresh insights from Sean Covey.
